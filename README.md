thanks to KN4CK3R for his UnrealEngineSDKGenerator

* i will try to keep this up to date.
* i am not repsonsible for how you use this.
* do not ask me how to use this.
* i do not guarantee it is perfectly aligned.

wise words from tj888:
Make sure to add in your Project both PUBG_Basic.cpp and PUBG_CoreUObject_functions.cpp  
If you want to use engine functions (You are internal, WHY WOULDN'T YOU! haha) add both PUBG_Engine_functions.cpp and PUBG_TslGame_functions.cpp as well  

Don't forget to complete the function GetGlobalNames() in PUBG_Basic.hpp and the function GetGlobalObjects() in PUBG_CoreUObject_classes.hpp
